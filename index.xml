      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I originated as a student in electrical engineering, majoring in telecommunications but ended up a software engineer.
My works revolve around software development and deployment. I have an avid interest in designing and implementing large
scale softwares, and distributed systems, which I am learning and discovering progressively, though I have not had very much
relevant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and project management are also under my umbrella of things I&amp;rsquo;d like to hone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me to learn from experimentation, from mistakes and from everybody. Together make a better self more than one of yesterday.
Feel free to drop me a message if you want to invite me a coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
