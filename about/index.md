# About


Hello. I originated from [Da Nang, Vietnam](https://www.google.fr/search?q=da+nang) as a student in electrical engineering, majoring in telecommunications and currently is a software engineer in [ÃŽle-de-France, France](https://www.google.fr/search?q=il+de+france).
My works revolve around software development and deployment. I have an avid interest in designing and implementing large
scale softwares, and distributed systems, which I am learning and discovering progressively, though I have not had very much
relevant experience. Machine learning and project management are also under my umbrella of things I'd like to hone.

Join me to learn from experimentation, from mistakes and from everybody. Together make a better self more than one of yesterday.

Feel free to drop me a message to hophuthai {at} gmail.com if you want to invite me a coffee.
