# Virtualization vs Containerization


## Semantic versioning

The versioning of docker images, as per Docker Hub, does not respect the rules of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A single image can share different tags as demonstrated in the photo. The tags feature a Major release, a Major.minor release, and a Major.minor.patch release.
